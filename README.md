# Lonely Planet India

Lonely planet India asked its fellow travelers to share stories of the special place to which they dream of returning. They featured my story on page no. 32 of Lonely Planet India June 2020 issue. This repository contains June 2020 of Loney Planet Magazine in which my story was published.
